## Overview
The Cyborg Oracle Feeder is the component of the Cyborg Network that ensures that the [Workers](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/Cyborg-worker-node) that are part of the network operate as expected. An explanation of how the oracle works can be found [here](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/cyborg-parachain/blob/master/Local%20Testing.md#status-aggregator-pallet-for-oracle).

## Testing
The Oracle Feeder can only reliably be tested when also testing other components of the network (Worker Node, Parachain, etc.). Detailed instructions on how to do so can be found [here](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/cyborg-parachain/blob/master/Local%20Testing.md#local-setup).
